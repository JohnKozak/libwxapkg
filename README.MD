A tool to unpacking Wechat applet packages.

Usage:

Download the `/bin/unwxapkg` into your PATH folder, add executable flag and execute `unwxapkg install` to install it from source.

Then

```
unwxapkg <filename>
```

or use `-h | --help` to see how to use.

The jar file will be installed into `~/.local/lib/classpath` by default. You can modify the script to change it.
